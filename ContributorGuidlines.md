#Contribution guidelines

This document explains how to contribute changes to the AddOns schema and supporting documentation, collectively referred to as the standard.

##Reporting issues

If you believe there is an issue with any part of the standard, first check that the [issues database](https://github.com/PriceComparisonStandardsGroup/AddOns/issues) doesn't already contain that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.  If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified of updates.

##Backwards compatibility

All changes, where possible should be backwards compatible.  In most cases this means the changes should be additive and optional, for example a new payment calculation method, or new elements added to the schema to extend functionality.

##Submitting changes

All changes must be submitted via a pull request and linked to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/PriceComparisonStandardsGroup/AddOns/issues).  If a GitHub issue doesn't already exist, please create one with as much information as possible to explain the reason for the changes.

Pull requests must be approved by at least 3 of the organisations involved in defining the standard, with no objections.  Once a pull request has been approved it will be merged to master.

##Contentious changes  

Any issue that receives an objection will be discussed at a bi-annual meeting, where a decision can be reached by all parties represented.
